        <p>Cashew Nuts</p>
    </div>
    <main class="body">
        <p>
            Cashew nuts are native to Brazil, where they have long been viewed as a delicacy. More recently, cashews
            have become popular throughout the world for their delicate flavor and extraordinary health benefits.
            Manufacturers always sell cashews in their shelled state, as part of the shell contains a resin that is not
            safe for consumption. However, it is possible to purchase raw cashews, roasted cashews, or cashews that have
            been seasoned with various flavorings. This means you can use them as a snack or as an addition to salads,
            smoothies, stir-fries and other meals. With each serving of cashews, you harness incredible health benefits
            that set them apart from other nuts.
        </p>
        <h2>Benefits of cashew nuts</h2>
        <h3>Eating Cashews Could Boost Your Immune System</h3>
        <p>In addition to containing high amounts of copper, cashews are a great source of zinc (WH Foods, 2014).
            Failing to get enough zinc compromises your immune system functioning, since this mineral is important for
            the development of immune system cells, production of antioxidant enzymes and activity of immune system
            regulators (Ho, 2013). Each 1-ounce serving of cashews provides 1.6 mg of zinc, helping you advance toward
            your recommended daily target of 11 mg for men and 8 mg for women. In numerous studies, boosting zinc intake
            has been associated with a healthier immune response, meaning that cashews could help you fight off your
            next cold (Ho, 2013).</p>
        <h3>Cashews Are Rich in Heart-Healthy Fatty Acids</h3>
        <p>Not all fats are bad for you, and some types of fat can actually help your heart health. Cashews contain
            heart-healthy monounsaturated fats, including oleic and palmitoleic acids (Nutrition and You, 2012). These
            are essential fatty acids that have been associated with lower levels of unhealthy LDL cholesterol and
            higher levels of healthy HDL cholesterol. As a result, consumption of the monounsaturated fats in cashews is
            associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease (Kris-Etherton, 1999).
            Cashews Provide Nearly 100 Percent of Your Recommended Daily Copper Intake Copper is a trace mineral that we
            get in very small amounts, mostly from animal sources such as crab, mussels, liver and oysters. The presence
            of copper is required for a variety of physiological reactions in the body (Prohaska, 2014), including
            reactions needed for energy production, the metabolism of iron, and neurotransmission. Failure to get enough
            copper has been associated with poor immune system functioning; higher risk of cardiovascular disease;
            increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s; and impaired bone health.

            Cashews are an excellent vegetarian source of copper, providing more of the mineral than most other non-meat
            sources. In fact, eating a quarter-cup of cashews every day gives you 98 percent of your recommended daily
            intake of copper, which may decrease your risk of chronic disease (WH Foods, 2014).</p>
        <h3>Cashews Are Protein Rich</h3>
        <p>Like all nuts, cashews provide an excellent source of protein. Protein is one of three macronutrients your
            body uses for energy, and it is particularly important for rebuilding muscle tissue and creating new
            cellular compounds. Plus, eating protein prevents you from getting hungry between meals, which can help you
            stick to a healthy eating plan.
            Although many nuts are good sources of protein, cashews stand apart from the pack because of their
            particularly well-balanced nutritional profile. Each ounce of cashews (about 16 to 18 nuts) contains 160
            calories, 5 grams of protein, and 13 grams of fat (most of it heart-healthy monounsaturated fats)
            (MacMillan, 2015). This makes them less calorie dense than other nuts such as macadamia nuts, which contain
            200 calories but only 2 grams of protein per ounce. Thus, eating cashews is an excellent snack choice for
            people following a low-calorie or high-protein diet.</p>
        <h3>Cashews Are an Excellent Source of Antioxidants</h3>
        <p>antioxidants, the compounds that counteract oxidative damage in the cell. Antioxidants sweep through the
            cell, neutralizing free radicals that can cause cellular damage. Some of the most potent antioxidants
            include vitamins E and K. Cashews contain both of the vitamins, helping your body fight off oxidative
            damage.</p>
        <h3>Cashews Contain No Cholesterol</h3>
        <p>Cholesterol is a waxy compound that accumulates in the blood, leading to plaque that can restrict
            cardiovascular functioning. Avoiding cholesterol in your diet can be a healthy choice that promotes optimal
            blood circulation. Cashews contain no cholesterol, making them an extraordinarily heart-healthy choice.</p>
        <h3>Eating Cashews Lowers Your Risk of Gallstones</h3>
        <p>Gallstones are made up of hardened cholesterol or a compound called bilirubin, and they can be extremely
            painful. In a study of more than 80,000 women, eating nuts such as cashews was associated with a 25 percent
            lower risk of developing gallstones (Ros, 2010). Thus, enjoying cashews every day could lower your risk of
            painful gallstones.</p>
